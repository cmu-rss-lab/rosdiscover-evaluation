# This file is used to build a Docker image for running the experiments.
# This can help to avoid the need to install specific versions of Python (i.e., >= 3.9)
# on older machines.
#
# The Docker image provided by this file is the preferred way to replicate the
# experiments presented in the paper. If you wish to extend or repurpose the work,
# you should perform the pipenv virtual environment installation instead.
