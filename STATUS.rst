Claims of the Artifact
======================

We believe that this artifact should be awarded both (a) Open Research Object (ORO) and (b) Research Object Reviewed (ROR) -- Reusable badges.
Below we make our case for the award of each of those badges.


Open Research Object (ORO)
--------------------------

The NISO Recommended Practice on Reproducibility Badging and Definitions give the following description of the ORO badge:

::

  This badge signals that author-created digital objects used in the research (including data and code)
  are permanently archived in a public repository that assigns a global identifier and guarantees
  persistence, and are made available via standard open licenses that maximize artifact availability.


Similarly, the ICSA artifact evaluation track website describes artifacts with the ORO badge as being:

::

  Functional + placed on a publicly accessible archival repository.
  A DOI or link to this repository along with a unique identifier for the object is provided (this matches the ACM “Available” badge).

**TODO: make our case.**


Research Object Reviewed (ROR) -- Reusable
