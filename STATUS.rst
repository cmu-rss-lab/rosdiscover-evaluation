Claims of the Artifact
======================

We believe that this artifact should be awarded both (a) Open Research Object (ORO) and (b) Research Object Reviewed (ROR) -- Reusable badges.
To qualify for either badge, artifacts must be functional, and so we first make a case that our artifact is functional before describing how it satisfies the criteria of the ORO and ROR badges.


Functional
----------

The `ICSA artifact evaluation track website <https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current>`_ deems an artifact to be Functional if it satisfies the criteria below:

::

  In order to obtain any badge every artifact will be required to be Functional, that is, it must be properly documented, consistent, complete, exercisable, and include appropriate evidence of verification and validation.

Where the definitions of documented, consistent, complete, and exercisable come from the `ACM policy on Artifact Review and Badging Version 1.1 <https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current>`_:

::

  Documented: At minimum, an inventory of artifacts is included, and sufficient description provided to enable the artifacts to be exercised.

  Consistent: The artifacts are relevant to the associated paper, and contribute in some inherent way to the generation of its main results.

  Complete: To the extent possible, all components relevant to the paper in question are included. (Proprietary artifacts need not be included. If they are required to exercise the package then this should be documented, along with instructions on how to obtain them. Proxies for proprietary data should be included so as to demonstrate the analysis.)

  Exercisable: Included scripts and/or software used to generate the results in the associated paper can be successfully executed, and included data can be accessed and appropriately manipulated.


Below, we argue how this artifact satifies each of the above criteria:

* **Documented:**
* **Consistent:**
* **Complete:**
* **Exercisable:**


Open Research Object (ORO)
--------------------------

The `NISO Recommended Practice on Reproducibility Badging and Definitions <https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/reproducibility-badging>`_ give the following description of the ORO badge:

::

  This badge signals that author-created digital objects used in the research (including data and code)
  are permanently archived in a public repository that assigns a global identifier and guarantees
  persistence, and are made available via standard open licenses that maximize artifact availability.


Similarly, the `ICSA artifact evaluation track website <https://icsa-conferences.org/2022/conference-tracks/artifact-evaluation-track>`_ describes artifacts with the ORO badge as being:

::

  Functional + placed on a publicly accessible archival repository.
  A DOI or link to this repository along with a unique identifier for the object is provided (this matches the ACM “Available” badge).

**TODO: make our case.**


Research Object Reviewed (ROR) -- Reusable
